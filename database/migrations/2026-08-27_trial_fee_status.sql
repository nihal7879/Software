-- A trial student who has used up their free hours is not a payment problem.
-- Before this, a trial that consumed exactly its allowance landed on
-- hours_left = 0 and so read "Payment Required", which is wrong and would have

-- Trials now report fee_status = 'Trial' whatever their balance. Enrolled
-- students are unchanged: hours_left <= 0 => Payment Required.
